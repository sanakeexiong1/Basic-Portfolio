        Hello and welcome! My name is Sanakee, I am a mother, learner, and lover of food. Here you can find my portfolio full of random images. Most of these images were found from Unsplash, a free source photo library. It's a great tool to use in comparison to Google Photos (also a great tool but can be annoying to find the image source). 

        In my free time I love to spend time with my family. I have a two year old son, Easton and a one year old daughter, Alina. Both are such a joy to watch interact and grow together. I also love to cook and try new foods!
